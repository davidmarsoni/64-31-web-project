            <p>The game project we're developing takes it's inspiration from iconic pixelated platform games such as Castlevania and Mario Bros. </p>
            <p>The objective of the game is quite straightforward:<strong> One must successfully navigate through various levels, defeat enemies, and avoid obstacles, all while striving to stay alive.</strong> </p>

            <p>The gameplay incorporates some basic features, such as:</p>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Character Control:</strong> The player can move their character around the game’s world, jumping over obstacles and using abilities to overcome challenges and defeat enemies.</li>
              <li><strong>Level Progression:</strong> Players progress through a series of levels, each with its unique layout, challenges, and enemies.</li>
              <li><strong>Enemies: </strong> They will spawn and try to kill you</li>
              <li><strong>Health System:</strong> The character has a health bar that depletes when encountering enemies or obstacles. The game ends when the health bar is empty, and the player has finished all the levels</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>These features meld together to create an immersive, engaging, and entertaining gameplay experience that keeps players engrossed and coming back for more.</p>

            <p>The pixel art design of the game pays homage to platformers, it's retro style successfully bringing back the nostalgia associated with these classical games.</p>

            <p>Regardless of whether you are an old fan of these classic adventures, or a new player yearning for a hint of past times, our game promises an unmatched experience full of excitement and challenge.</p>
